Practice with Single Row Functions

Considering the data exists in the city table, write a query that will return records similar to what is shown below for those cities that have the COUNTRYCODE of 'cbd' :

"NEW YORK CITY has the population of 8,500,000"

"LOS ANGELES has the population of 632,000"

Note: I'd like you to use functions in the SELECT statement to solve this problem.

SELECT CONCAT(CONCAT(UPPER(name), ' has the population of '), population)

FROM city

WHERE LOWER(countrycode) = 'cbd';



Write a query that would show the first three letters and the last three letters of the DISTRICT capitalized and separated by a dash.

Note: I'd like you to use functions in the SELECT statement to solve this problem.

SELECT CONCAT(CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTR(district, 1, 3)), ' - '),

       UPPER(SUBSTR(district, LENGTH(district) - 2)))

FROM city;



Review the following SQL statement:

SELECT MONTHS_BETWEEN(LAST_DAY('15-JAN-12') + 1, '01-APR-12') FROM DUAL;

Considering the database is configured for the given date format, what will be the result of executing the query?

-2

The reason -2 will be returned is that the LAST_DAY function will transform the value of '15-JAN-12' TO '31-JAN-12' and then the result of that will be added to 1. So the first argument of the MONTHS_BETWEEN function ends up being '01-FEB-12'. Difference between the 2 dates results in a -2.



TRUE or FALSE Question:

Giving the date arguments in chronological order to the MONTHS_BETWEEN function will result in an error.

FALSE.

You may give the 2 dates in any order you please. If the dates are in chronological order, the result will be a negative number. If the dates are in reverse chronological order, the answer will be a positive number.



Which of the following is true regarding character functions?

A). They always accept characters as parameters and nothing else.

B). They always return a character value.

C). They are generally used to process text data.

D). They generally have the letters CHAR somewhere in the function name.

Answer: C



Which of the following is true regarding functions in SQL?

A). They never return a value.

B). They often return a value.

C). They always return a value.

D). There is no consistent answer to whether they return a value or not.

Answer: C



Review the SQL Statement:

SELECT SUBSTR('2009', 1, 2) || LTRIM('1124', '1') FROM DUAL;

What will be the result of executing the SQL Statement?

A). 2024

B). 221

C). 20124

D). A syntax error

Answer: A



TRUE or FALSE Question:

Review the syntax of how the NULLIF function is used:

NULLIF( expr1, expr2 )

The NULLIF function returns expr1 if expr1 and expr2 are not equal.

TRUE



TRUE or FALSE Question:

The TO_CHAR function converts data from various data types to character data. It can accept characters, a number or a date as valid arguments.

TRUE
